V. GREEDY ALGORITHM

<5.2 Basic Greedy Algorithm>
-Shortest-job-first Scheduling : To make entire average time in wait, the shortest time-consume tasks goes in first
    1) Since the shortest job is on first, the later jobs' waiting time get decreased
    2) There can happen "Starvation" which means two long-time jobs cannot be done by once
    3) It is rare case because it is unusual to know each job's time-consume


<5.3 Knapsack Problem>
- Optimal Combination problem
- 0-1 Knapsack problem / Fraction Knapsack problem
- 0-1 kp is known as NP-complete.
- Fraction one can be solved with Greedy way
    1) get (value per same standard amount)
