IV. DIVIDE AND CONQUER

-if the problem can be solved with polynomial-time algorithm, then it is called "Class P"
 there're other things
    -NP(non-deterministic polynomial time) : it can be proved in p time but there're no known solution
    -EXPTIME(exponential time)
    -PSPACE(polynomial space)


<4.2 Binary Search>
-If the given sequence is well-sorted, then we can use binary Search
-Simply, get the median of sequence, and compare. repeat this until the target is found.
