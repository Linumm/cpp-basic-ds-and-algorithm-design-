IV. DIVIDE AND CONQUER

-if the problem can be solved with polynomial-time algorithm, then it is called "Class P"
 there're other things
    -NP(non-deterministic polynomial time) : it can be proved in p time but there're no known solution
    -EXPTIME(exponential time)
    -PSPACE(polynomial space)


<4.2 Binary Search>
-If the given sequence is well-sorted, then we can use binary Search
-Simply, get the median of sequence, and compare. repeat this until the target is found.


<4.3>
-Divide : Divide to several sub problem that can be solved in same way
-Conquer : get an answer
-Combine : combine answers from sub problem to get a solution


<4.4 Sorting algorithm with Divide-and-Conquer>
-The requirement to Sort algorithm
    1) General to all data type
    2) Handle huge amount of data (even more than computer's main memory)
    3) Speed (Time complexity)
